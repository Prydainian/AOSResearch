This directory contains a basic gamma law equation of state. 
More advanced equation of state routines can be found in our 
Microphysics repository.

gamma_law:

   A simple gamma-law EOS.  This computes the mean molecular
   weight from the mass fractions and the species properties defined
   in the network module.  

   NOTE: this simple version of the EOS does not compute all of the
   thermodynamic variables defined in the eos_type, but only those
   needed for Castro's execution.  

   A full implementation of the gamma_law EOS is available as
   gamma_law_general in the Microphysics/ repo
