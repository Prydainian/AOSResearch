**** DIAGNOSTIC ROUTINES ****

The diagnostic routines in fdustcollapse*d.f90 are used to construct 
the data which appears in Figure 12 in the first CASTRO paper.

The analytic maximum density has been computed from the initial density 
and the analytic r(t) using conservation of mass; this is hard-wired
into each fdustcollapse*f90 file.

The radius of the star in each plotfile is computed by first computing the
radial average of density, then finding the radius at which 
the density equals half of the analytic maximum density.

Typing 'make' will build the diagnostic routines for 1D, 2D and 3D.

**** ANALYTIC SOLUTION ****

To make the analytic profile, type 

gfortran analytic.f90

then

a.out > analytic.txt

**** PLOTTING ****

To use gnuplot to make Figure 12, use DustCollapse.gp once you have created the files
analytic.txt, results_1d.txt, results_2d.txt and results_3d.txt
