These are things that need to be better documented:

-- The gravity solver options that Max put in, same with rotation options

-- Retries

-- Burning timestep limiters

-- Checkpoint versioning

-- problem tagging, problem specific files / includes

-- problem_post_init

-- density resetting -- see Max's thesis

-- internal energy switches -- again from Max's thesis (2.1)

-- hybrid advection
