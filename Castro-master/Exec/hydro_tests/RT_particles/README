This problem takes the Rayleigh-Taylor problem from the Castro/Exec/RT
directory and adds particles.  These particles are moved with the
fluid velocity each time step, and if they leave the domain then they
just "disappear."

This test is primarily designed to test the ability of Castro to handle 
particles.
