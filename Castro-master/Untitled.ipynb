    "*an adaptive mesh, astrophysical radiation hydrodynamics simulation code*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`Castro` is an adaptive-mesh compressible radiation hydrodynamics\n",
    "code for astrophysical flows.  `Castro` supports a general equation of\n",
    "state, full Poisson gravity, and reactive flows, and is parallelized\n",
    "with MPI + OpenMP.\n",
    "\n",
    "More information on Castro can be found here:\n",
    "\n",
    "http://amrex-astro.github.io/Castro/\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "You can download Castro and all the necessary dependencies (AMReX and\n",
    "the Microphysics repo) using the script:\n",
    "\n",
    "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AMReX-Astro/Castro/development/Util/scripts/get_castro.sh\n",
    "\n",
    "Running this will clone the repositories and create a file\n",
    "`castro_exports.sh` which you can source or copy to your `.bashrc`\n",
    "to define the necessary environment variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The User's Guide in `Castro/Docs/` (type `make` to build from\n",
    "LaTeX source) will guide you through running your first problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "A PDF of the User's Guide can be found at\n",
    "\n",
    "http://bender.astro.sunysb.edu/Castro/staging/Castro/Docs/CastroUserGuide.pdf\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Call Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "A doxygen-generated call graph for `Castro` is available here:\n",
    "\n",
    "http://bender.astro.sunysb.edu/Castro/staging/Castro/html/\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Development Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "Development generally follows the following ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * New features are committed to the `development` branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Nightly regression testing is used to ensure that no answers\n",
    "    change (or if they do, that the changes were expected).\n",
    "\n",
    "    If a change is critical, we can cherry-pick the commit from\n",
    "    `development` to `master`.\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Contributions are welcomed from anyone.  *Any contributions that\n",
    "    have the potential to change answers should be done via pull\n",
    "    requests.*   A pull request should be generated from your fork of\n",
    "    Castro and target the `development` branch.  (If you mistakenly\n",
    "    target `master`, we can change it for you.)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Please add a line to `CHANGES` summarizing your change if it\n",
    "    is a bug fix or new feature.  Reference the PR or issue as\n",
    "    appropriate. Additionally, if your change fixes a bug (or if\n",
    "    you find a bug but do not fix it), and there is no current\n",
    "    issue describing the bug, please file a separate issue describing\n",
    "    the bug, regardless of how significant the bug is. If possible,\n",
    "    in both the `CHANGES` file and the issue, please cite the pull\n",
    "    request numbers or git commit hashes where the problem was\n",
    "    introduced and fixed, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "    If there are a number of small commits making up the PR, we may\n",
    "    wish to squash commits upon merge to have a clean history.\n",
    "    *Please ensure that your PR title and first post are descriptive,\n",
    "    since these will be used for a squashed commit message.*\n",
    "\n",
    "  * On the first workday of each month, we perform a merge of\n",
    "    `development` into `master`, in coordination with `AMReX`,\n",
    "    `Maestro`, and `Microphysics`.  For this merge to take place, we\n",
    "    need to be passing the regression tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "    To accommodate this need, we close the merge window into\n",
    "    `development` a few days before the merge day.  While the merge\n",
    "    window is closed, only bug fixes should be pushed into\n",
    "    `development`.  Once the merge from `development` -> `master` is\n",
    "    done, the merge window reopens.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Developers\n",
    "\n",
    "People who make a number of substantive contributions will be named\n",
    "\"core developers\" of Castro.  The criteria for becoming a core\n",
    "developer are flexible, but generally involve one of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * 10 non-merge commits to `Castro/Source/` or `Castro/Docs/` or one\n",
    "    of the problems that is not your own science problem *or*\n",
    "\n",
    "  * addition of a new algorithm / module  *or*\n",
    "\n",
    "  * substantial input into the code design process or testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Core developers will be recognized in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * invited to the group's slack team\n",
    "\n",
    "  * listed in the User's Guide and website as a core developer\n",
    "\n",
    "  * invited to co-author general code papers / proceedings describing\n",
    "    Castro, its performance, etc.  (Note: science papers will always\n",
    "    be left to the science leads to determine authorship).\n",
    "\n",
    "If a core developer is inactive for 3 years, we may reassess their\n",
    "status as a core developer.\n",
